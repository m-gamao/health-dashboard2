Thanks for following along on my Health App Journey! I designed the UI mockups in Figma. I'm approaching this systematically and the technical requirements are listed below. The first Epic is the creation of the Dashboard which is the homepage of the app. It will remind the user of their medications, current appointments, and health metrics/readings that are important to them and their goals.

*MVP - Technical Requirements:*

*Tasks completed:*
1. Build the green sidebar.
2. Add App Name (header) and Logo.
3. Add navigation items list.
4. Add the page backdrop (which will appear on every page of the app).

*To Do List:*

*Dashboard tasks:*

*Medication Reminders*
1. Add container for the Medication Reminder section.
2. Add header and logo in a separate container.
3. Add edit button and functionality to #2.
4. Add the display field for the medication name and time (separate container).
5. Build API call to database for the medication/time.
6. Connect the Edit button to the Medication Reminder Settings page.

*Appointments Reminders*:
1. Add container for the Appointments Reminder section.
2. Add header and logo in a separate container.
3. Add edit button and functionality to #2.
4. Add the display field for the appointment name, date and time (separate container).
5. Build API call to database for the appointment name, date, and time.
6. Connect the Edit button to the Appointments Settings page.

*Appointments Calendar*:
1. Add container for the Appointments Calendar section.
2. Add header and logo in a separate container.
3. Add edit button and functionality to #2.
4. Add the display field for the calendar (separate container).
5. Build API call to database for the appointment dates.
6. Connect the Edit button to the Appointments Settings page.

*Smart Health*:
1. Add container for the Smart Health section.
2. Add header and logo in a separate container.
3. Add edit button and functionality to #2.
4. Add the display field for the appointment name, date and time (separate container).
5. Build API call to database for the appointment name, date, and time.
6. Connect the Edit button to the Appointments Settings page.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
